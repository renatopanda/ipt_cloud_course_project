# Cloud Computing and Virtualization - Project Base App

This repo contains the demo web application that should be used as base in the final project (versions A + B). It consists of a web app (`/app`), and a websockets server (`/ws`). These run in a single Linux VM provisioned with Vagrant and shell scripts.

## Vagrant
The VM is defined in the Vagrantfile. Currently uses Ubuntu Server 22.04 and both services run on it. The provisioning is defined in the `provision/web.sh` script, which will:
* Install Apache2 HTTP Server
* Install PHP (and other libraries)
* Install PostgreSQL
  * Create a database and user
  * Import the `provision/dump.sql` script
* Run composer to install dependencies
* Setup the web app in apache2
* Update the `DEPLOY_DATE` in the `.env` file

You are free to change it as needed to achieve your desired configuration. If RAM/CPU is an issue, you might want to consider using a lighter distro, such as Alpine Linux, for some of your VMs (see [generic/alpine38](https://app.vagrantup.com/generic/boxes/alpine38) or [boxomatic/alpine-3.18](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxomatic/boxes/alpine-3.18), note that the package manager and other commands are different so you need to Google).

After provisioning, the web app should be accessible at http://192.168.44.10. In this base version, you must manually start the WebSockets server (see below).

## Web App
The web app is a set of small php pages (security was not a concern) that ilustrate typical functionalities of a modern application, namely:
* Static / simple pages
* Sessions
* Database layer
* File uploads
* Data via WebSockets

Dependencies are installed via `composer`, and settings are defined in the `.env` file.

## WebSockets Server
The websockets server is a simple one file server, which receives messages on port 8000 and broadcasts to all connected clients. Dependencies are also installed via composer. It uses `Ratchet` as the websockets server, and should be started in the CLI with:
```bash
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant/ws
php websockets_server.php
# you my want to configure it as a daemon / service to autostart by default
```

## Load Testing
If you want to load test the web app, you can download tools such as [hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey), or [vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta), and run sets of requests against specific endpoints.

Example under Win10, using Git BASH:
```bash
# create a folder to dl the tools (outside of the project)
mkdir HTTPLoad
cd HTTPLoad

# download hey and vegeta
curl -o hey.exe https://hey-release.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hey_windows_amd64
curl -LJO https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta/releases/download/v12.8.3/vegeta-12.8.3-windows-amd64.zip
unzip vegeta-12.8.3-windows-amd64.zip
rm vegeta-12.8.3-windows-amd64.zip

# check help (under other cli you might use hey.exe...)
./hey -h
./vegeta -h

# run hey with default settings
./hey http://192.168.44.10/db.php
